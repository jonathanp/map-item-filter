# Map Item Filter

This is a proof of concept of a single page application that can be used for filtering items by categories and/or by zooming and panning in a map.

The goal of this project is for me to try to recreate the core of an app I wrote a couple of years ago but with different technologies and a different architecture.

## Technologies used

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io)

* [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
